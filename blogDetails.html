              You may know that small businesses are the backbone of the economy, making up 90% of businesses worldwide. But are you aware that 82% of them feel their banks aren’t giving them the services they need to effectively manage their finances?
              It’s a shocking statistic, I know, but it represents a major opportunity for financial institutions.
             <br>
              It all starts with adopting a single-platform approach for both your customer and employee journeys, giving you consistency and empowering you to make better decisions across the lifecycle of your customers’ businesses. A platform model also allows you to master the “basics” of business banking – including quick and transparent credit decision-making and fast, low-cost transactions – that are non-negotiable in today’s market. From customer onboarding to customer servicing, customer loyalty, and loan origination, we’ve got you covered.
              Financial institutions, it’s time to dream big. You’ve earned the trust of your customers, and you have all the services that business owners need. That puts you in a great position to play a primary role in addressing their needs at every stage of their lifecycle. By moving to a platform model, you’ll capitalize on the situation and future-proof your bank for the years to come.
